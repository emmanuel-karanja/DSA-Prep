/**The top view of a Binary Search Tree (or any binary tree) consists of the nodes that
 *  are visible when the tree is viewed from the top â€” meaning the first node encountered at 
 * each horizontal distance (HD) from the root.
 * 
 * 
 * LOGIC:
 * Again do a BFS on a tree and keep track of the horizontal distance.
 * 
 * Imagine the root has a horizontal distance of 0 and all the other nodes at each level are displaced
 * outwards from it. 
 * 
 * left subtree nodes will have negative horizontal distances and right subtree nodes positive ones.
 * 
 * We keep track of hd=>NodeValue mappings in the topViewMap
 * 
 * We also keep track of the previous left and right displacements(minHd, and maxHd) respectively
 * and use that to compute horizontal distances for the next level we iterate to.
