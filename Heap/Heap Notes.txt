A Min Heap is a binary heap where the smallest element is always at the root. 
It efficiently supports insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the minimum element in 

O(logn) time.

A Max Heap is a binary heap where the largest element is always at the root. 
It efficiently supports insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the minimum element in 

O(logn) time.
