/**
 * Problem Definition:
 * -------------------
 * Given three strings s1, s2, and s3, determine if s3 is formed by an interleaving 
 * of s1 and s2. Interleaving means s3 can be formed by merging s1 and s2 in a way 
 * that preserves the order of characters from each string.
 * (LeetCode 97: Interleaving String)
 *
 * Example:
 *   s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
 *   Output: true
 *   Explanation: s3 can be formed by taking characters from s1 and s2 in order.
 *
 * Intuition:
 * ----------
 * Use dynamic programming to decide whether prefixes of s1 and s2 can form a 
 * prefix of s3. If a prefix of s3 ends with a character from s1 or s2, 
 * check whether removing that character leaves a smaller interleaving problem 
 * that is already solvable.
 *
 * Logic:
 * ------
 * 1. If lengths donâ€™t match (s1.length + s2.length !== s3.length), return false.
 * 2. Define a DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] indicates whether the first i 
 *    characters of s1 and first j characters of s2 can form the first i+j characters of s3.
 * 3. Base case: dp[0][0] = true (empty strings match).
 * 4. Fill the table:
 *    - If s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1], inherit dp[i-1][j].
 *    - If s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1], inherit dp[i][j-1].
 *    - Use logical OR because either choice may lead to a match.
 * 5. Return dp[m][n] as the final answer.
