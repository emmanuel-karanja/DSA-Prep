/**The Minimum Window Substring problem asks you to find the smallest contiguous substring in a given string s that contains all characters of another string t, 
 * including duplicates. 
 * 
 * Problem Statement: Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window substring of s that contains 
 *  all characters in t. If there is no such substring, return an empty string.
 * LOGIC:
 * 
 * We use the Sliding Window + Two Pointers technique:

1Ô∏è. Create a Map for t where the key is the char and value is the character count in t.
2. Expand the right pointer (r) to include characters from s until all characters in t are present.
3. Contract the left pointer (l) to remove unnecessary characters while still containing t.
4. Track the smallest valid window found.
