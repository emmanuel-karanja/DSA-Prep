/**Given two strings s and t, find the minimum-length window in s that contains any anagram of t.

This is similar to the "minimum window substring" problem, but you only need to match the counts of characters in t
 (not the exact order). So any permutation (anagram) is fine.

ðŸ§  Approach (Sliding Window + Frequency Maps):
Count the frequency of characters in t.

Use a sliding window of size up to t.length and track frequencies in s.

As soon as the window contains all characters with the correct count â€” i.e., forms an anagram â€”
  try to shrink from the left to get the smallest such window. */
