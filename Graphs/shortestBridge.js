/**You are given a 2D binary grid (a grid of 0s and 1s) where there are exactly two islands.
 *  An island is a group of connected 1s (connected vertically or horizontally). 
 * Your task is to build the shortest bridge (flip 0s to 1s) to connect the two islands.
 * 
 * LOGIC:
 * 
1.Find and mark the first island.
2.Use DFS or BFS to locate and mark the first island (1s) and collect its edge coordinates.
3.Expand from the first island using BFS.
4. Use BFS starting from the perimeter of the first island, expanding layer by layer until you reach the second island
 (1 in the grid that isnâ€™t visited).
5. The number of layers expanded is the shortest bridge length.
