/*Given an nÃ—n binary matrix grid, where:

0 represents an open cell (can be traversed).
1 represents a blocked cell (cannot be traversed).
Find the shortest path from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (n-1,n-1), 
moving in 8 possible directions (including diagonals). Return the length of the shortest path. 
If no path exists, return -1.

LOGIC: Use BFS  on the Matrix

Edge Cases

1. If grid[0][0] == 1 or grid[n-1][n-1] == 1, return -1 (no possible path).
2. If n == 1 and grid[0][0] == 0, return 1 (starting point is also the endpoint).

Initialize BFS

1. Use a queue ([row, col, steps]) to track position and path length.
2. Mark visited cells. Set them to blocked
4. Explore 8 Directions

5. Move up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
6. Ensure moves are within bounds and go only through open cells (0s).
7. Stop When Reaching (n-1, n-1)

8. The first time we reach bottom-right, return the steps.
