DFS vs BFS: When to Use Each?
Both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms. The choice between them depends on the problem you're solving and the structure of the graph.

1. When to Use DFS
DFS explores a path deeply before backtracking, making it useful for problems that require exhaustive exploration or backtracking.

âœ… Best for:
Scenario	Reason
Pathfinding in a maze--->DFS explores one path deeply, making it useful when searching for any path from A to B.
Detecting cycles in a graph	If a visited node is encountered again before completing traversal, there's a cycle.
Topological sorting (DAGs)	-->DFS helps order tasks when dependencies exist (e.g., course scheduling).
Connected components in an undirected graph	DFS helps find all nodes in a component efficiently.
Solving puzzles (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens)	Backtracking algorithms often use DFS to explore solutions deeply.
Tree traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)	DFS is naturally suited for hierarchical structures like trees.
Finding bridges & articulation points	Used in Tarjanâ€™s algorithm for network reliability analysis.
ðŸš« When NOT to Use DFS:
If the shortest path is needed (e.g., in an unweighted graph).
If the graph is very deep, DFS can cause stack overflow due to recursion.
2. When to Use BFS
BFS explores all neighbors before moving to the next level, making it ideal for shortest-path problems and scenarios requiring level-order processing.

âœ… Best for:
Scenario	Reason
Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph	BFS guarantees the shortest path because it explores all possible paths level by level.
Solving word ladder problems (e.g., transforming "hit" â†’ "cog")	Each transformation is a level in the BFS tree.
Finding the smallest number of moves in a board game (e.g., Chess - Knightâ€™s shortest path)	BFS ensures the fewest moves are taken.
Network broadcasting (spreading messages in networks)	BFS models the spreading process layer by layer.
Finding all nodes at a given depth in a tree or graph	BFS naturally processes nodes level-wise.
Web crawling	Web crawlers explore sites breadth-first, fetching URLs from a queue.
Connected components in large graphs	BFS avoids deep recursion issues seen in DFS.

ðŸš« When NOT to Use BFS:
If the graph is huge, BFS can consume too much memory due to storing all nodes at a level.
If you're dealing with problems requiring deep recursion, DFS is often more efficient.

*And yet there is an iterative solution using a stack for DFS. 

*Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(V+E)
