/**You're given a 2D grid where each cell can be:

0: Empty cell
1: Fresh orange
2: Rotten orange

Rules:

1.Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
2.Return the minimum number of minutes needed until no cell has a fresh orange.
3.If it is impossible to rot all fresh oranges, return -1.

LOGIC
This is a multi-source BFS problem because multiple rotten oranges can start rotting their neighbors at the same time.

Steps:
1. Add all initially rotten oranges (value = 2) to a queue, with time = 0.
2. Count total fresh oranges.

Run BFS:

1. For each rotten orange in the queue, rot adjacent fresh oranges.
2. Add newly rotten oranges to the queue with time + 1.
3. Decrease the fresh count.
4. After BFS, if fresh count > 0 â†’ return -1; else, return total minutes passed.
