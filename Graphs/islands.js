/**You are given an m Ã— n grid grid where:

'1' represents land
'0' represents water
An island is formed by connecting adjacent land cells ('1') horizontally or vertically.
Find the number of distinct islands in the grid.

Clue: Treat each cell as a node in a graph. It's connected to 4 neighbours left, right, bottom top

Basically, if you find a 1 you check the neighbours, if any of them is a 1, you continue doing the same

LOGIC:

1. Iterate the matrix 
2. Do a DFS on any cell found to be '1' and increment island count


TWIST: It could be 1 represents land and 0 water and you are asked to count the body of waters.*/
