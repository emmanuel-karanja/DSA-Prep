/**You're given a list of schedules for multiple employees. Each employee's schedule is represented 
 * as a list of non-overlapping intervals when they are busy. The goal is to find the common free time
 *  slots available to all employees.
 * 
 * LOGIC:
 * 
 * 1. Flatten all schedules into a single list of busy intervals.
   2. Sort intervals by start time.
   3. Merge overlapping intervals to get a consolidated list of busy times.
   4. Find gaps between merged busy intervals â€“ these are the common free times.
